# ROCK🪨 - PAPER🚮 - SCISSORS✂️
## *This is the classical "Paper, rock, scissors" game, but you can add a twist if you want...*

### **Buttons** ⬇️
#### There are three buttons at the top, one for rock, one for paper and one for scissors.
####   - You can click any botton, to start the game.
####   - You can also press in your keyboard `R` for rock, `P` for paper and `S` for scissors. This will be just like clicking.
#### There are at the bottom two buttons...
#### ☢️ "RESET SCORE" ➡ You can click it or press `backspace` in your keyboard, and then, all the history of the plays will be deleted.
#### 🤖 "AUTOPLAY" ➡ This is the difference. If you want to watch a "PC vs. PC" match, simply click this button or press `A` on your keyboard to activate this feature.
