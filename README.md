# ROCK🪨 - PAPER🚮 - SCISSORS✂️
## *This is the classical "Paper, rock, scissors" game, but you can add a twist if you want...*

### 🟡**Buttons**
#### There are three buttons at the top, one for rock, one for paper and one for scissors.
#####   🡆 You can click any botton, to start the game.
#####   🡆 You can also press on your keyboard `R` for rock, `P` for paper and `S` for scissors. This will be just like clicking.
#### There are two buttons at the bottom...
##### ☢️ "RESET SCORE" 🡆 You can click it or press `backspace` on your keyboard, and then, all the history of the plays will be deleted.
##### 🤖 "AUTOPLAY" 🡆 This is the difference. If you want to watch a "PC vs. PC" match, simply click this button or press `A` on your keyboard to activate this feature.

### 🟢**How it works**
#### When you start the game, clicking `Rock`, `Paper` or `Scissors` (or pressing "R", "P" or "S"), inmediatly the "PC" choose one of these options.
#### Then the program compares your election with `PC's option`.
#### 🡆 If you have selected an option that beats `PC's option`, you win.
#### 🡆 If you selected an option that doesn't beat the `PC's option`, but also doesn't lose compared to it, then it's a tie.
#### 🡆 If you have selected an option that is beated by `PC's option`, you lose.

### *All of these rounds will be saved in the Local Storage, until you click "RESET SCORE"*
